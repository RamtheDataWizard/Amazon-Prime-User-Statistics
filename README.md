Unveiling Prime User Demographics: A Looker Studio Analysis  (#LookerStudio #DataAnalysis #AmazonPrime)

I explored user demographics of a fictional Amazon Prime dataset from Kaggle to understand user distribution by age groups.

Here's what I did:

Extracted: Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
Cleaned: Ensured data quality by checking for inconsistencies and irrelevant fields.
Loaded: Uploaded the clean data into Looker Studio for visualization.
Calculated Age: Created a calculated field to determine user age based on current date and date of birth.
Age Groups: Defined another calculated field to categorize users into age groups: "Young Adults," "Middle Adults," "Old Adults," and "90+."
This project demonstrates the power of Looker Studio for analyzing user data and gaining insights into customer demographics.
